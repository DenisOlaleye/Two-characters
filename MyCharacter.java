/*Computer games often contain different characters or creatures. For example, you might design a game in which alien beings possess specific characteristics
such as color, number of eyes, or number of lives. Design a character for a game, creating a class to hold at least three attributes for the character. 
Include methods to get and set each of the characterâ€™s attributes. Save the file as MyCharacter.*/
